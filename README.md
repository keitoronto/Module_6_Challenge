## Background

**Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that you’re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

For this homework assignment, you’ll use real estate data from San Francisco. 

* First, you will show sold number of housing units from 2010 to 2016 in a bar graph to see the trend.
* Second, you will show the gross rent and the sale price per square foot from 2010 to 2016 as a line chart.
* Third, you will extend the line chart you previously created to make it more interactive. You will show the gross rent and the sale price per square foot from 2010 to 2016 with the neighbourhood. You will create a dropdown menu with the neighbourhood. The chart will show based on your neighbourhood choice.
* Lastly, you will combine geomap data with real estate sale data and show a map with gross rent and the sale price per square foot.
